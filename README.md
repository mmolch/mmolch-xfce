# mmolch-xfce
A theme for xfce, based on Yaru Blue, contains xfwm4 and gtk themes

I also included a small icon theme that contains the window manager icons from
the Yaru icon theme which my window manager theme is based on.
Those icons are used by client side decorated applications (Firefox, Nautilus...)
To use it, copy or symlink the folder "mmolch-xfce" in the "icons" folder
to ~/.local/share/icons/ and ediut the index.theme file to inherit from your
icon theme.
